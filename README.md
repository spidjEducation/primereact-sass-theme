## Usage

To compile the CSS once:

```shell
npm install
npm run sass
```

To watch the SASS files for changes and re-compile:

```shell
npm install
npm run sass-watch
```

## Compile and copy CSS files to the PrimeReact repository

Usually you want to update the CSS files in the PrimeReact repository, located in the
`/primereact/public/themes` folder. To do so you can use the following scripts.

These scripts asume that the PrimeReact repository is located next to this repository, so at `../primereact`.
They will compile the CSS files and copy the resulting CSS files to the correct resources folders.

### Unix

```shell
./build.sh
```

### Windows

```shell
build.bat
```

sass --update themes/kemoms/kemoms-light/theme.scss:themes/kemoms/kemoms-light/theme.css
